                        technology agnostic, able to work on either PHP or .NET platforms.</p>
                    <p>Any web site or system that we develop will first have a specification document defining the
                        platform, application software, database and any other technologies to be used in the project,
                        together with a plan of how all of the systems are to interact.</p>
                    <p>A web site can have a number of different systems that need to be tied together on a page to
                        present the correct information. Typical systems may include the database, a postcode locator
                        system, a shopping basket, or online booking application, for example. Our team are experienced
                        in systems integrations across a range of technologies.</p>
                    <p>In addition to adhering to recognised standards such as W3C, as well as our own proprietary
                        standards, we have robust QA systems in place to ensure quality. During the build, technical
                        testing of each component will take place to ensure that the web site or application is
                        functioning correctly. Usability testing occurs during the build process too to ensure usability
                        of the application or web site. Lastly user acceptance testing ensures that the system fully
                        meets the demands of our clients.</p>

                        into account cultural variance, ensuring the design has the capacity for differing word counts

                    <p>Our project managers will ensure that each project is planned, scheduled and organised to deliver
                        according to a pre-agreed project plan. We utilise a mixture of project management approaches,
                        combining the best of both agile and waterfall methodologies.</p>
                    <p>Project management is much more than just ensuring delivery to a defined schedule - although that
                        of course is a key requirement. However, we think it's much more about great communication,
                        motivating a team to get the best out of them and great tenacity to ensure that every possible
                        angle is considered and covered off.</p>
                    <p>Our clients appreciate all of these qualities as well as the help, advice and support that we
                        provide, all delivered in plain English so you understand why we do things the way we do.</p>
